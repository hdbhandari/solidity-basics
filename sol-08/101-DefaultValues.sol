  - ^0.8.0 defines that no earlier versions will be supported than 0.8.0 and no major version i.e. 0.9.0 will be supported
  - We can also use >= and <= etc operations to define range of versions
  - >=0.4.0 < 0.6.0 means that the contract can be compiled by any compiler versions between 0.4.0 and 0.6.0, (0.4.0 inclusive)
  - If we'd write it as pragma solidity ^0.8.0 it would mean >=0.8.0 and <0.9.0
