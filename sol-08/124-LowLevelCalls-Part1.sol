/* 
- In these contracts, we can understand difference between transfer and send methods

- Reference: https://ethereum-blockchain-developer.com/2022-04-smart-wallet/07-low-level-calls-in-depth/

** How to run below contract?

- Deploy the Sender contract
- fund the Sender contract with some 100 wei (hit transact to let it go to the receive function)
- Deploy the ReceiverNoAction and copy the contract address
- Send 10 wei to the ReceiverNoAction wiht withdrawTransfer. 
    It works, because the function receive in ReceiverNoAction doesn't 
    do anything and doesn't use up more than 2300 gas
- Send 10 wei to the ReceiverNoAction with withdrawSend. 
    It also works, because the function still does not need more than 2300 gas.
- Deploy the ReceiverAction Smart contract and copy the contract address
- Send 10 Wei to the ReceiverAction with withdrawTransfer. It fails, because the contract tries 
    to write a storage variable which costs too much gas.
- Send 10 Wei to the ReceiverAction with withdrawSend. The transaction doesn't fail, 
    but it also doesn't work, which leaves you now in an odd state. üëàüèª That's the Problem right here.
